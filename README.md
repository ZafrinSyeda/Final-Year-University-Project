Final Year Project Repository

These are interfaces that have been developed for the Royal Holloway Third Year Computer Science Individual Project, with the project focus being Human Computer Interaction. 

As of 22/03/2022: 
There are 3 folders with the programs for 3 interface prototypes, two of them (charity-shop-interface and social-media-interface) are web applications that have been developed using React, the remaining folder (letter-tracing-interface) is an Android app developed using Android studios. 

For information on how to use the interfaces, please refer to the README files within each respective folder. 

The folder 'letter-tracing-apk' consists of the prepared build-ready APK files made from the letter tracing app. Within the folder 'release', in order to download and use the app on an android phone, 'app-release.apk' can be downloaded on your phone. For instance, this can be emailed to send it to your phone, or download it from this github repository. In order to download it, you will need to allow 'install apps from unknown sources'. For more information how that can be achieved, please refer to Android's guide to this: https://developer.android.com/studio/publish#publishing-unknown
Alternatively to view the app in use, refer to the youtube video: -PROVIDE LINK-

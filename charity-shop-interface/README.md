This is one of the interfaces designed for the final year HCI project. The idea behind the project is to act as a website that aims to help charity shops, by providing a space where users can shop and donate both items or money to the charities that the website is partnered with. (None of these are real companies). This project was created using the React library. 

In order to run this interface, Node.js needs to be installed. 

To be able to view the interface and interact with it within a browser, the file must be opened, and the command 'npm start' should be ran. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

In order to run the tests that were created for this interface, the command 'npm test' should be ran, and then 'a' should be entered in order to run all of the tests. 

All images used are free to use stock images. 
Asides from React, the 'styled-components' library was used, and the 'material-ui' framework for React. Dependencies are more explicity explained in the package.json file.

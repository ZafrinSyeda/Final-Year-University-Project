This is one of the interfaces designed for the final year HCI project. The idea behind the project is to act as a social media website where users would be able to upload posts relating to some hobby of the user. This project was created using the React library. 

In order to run this interface, Node.js needs to be installed. 

To be able to view the interface and interact with it within a browser, the file must be opened, and the command 'npm start' should be ran. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. Once open a login page will be displayed, the username is 'UserA' and the password is 'password123' in order to login. 

In order to run the tests that were created for this interface, the command 'npm test' should be ran, and then 'a' should be entered in order to run all of the tests. 

All images used are free to use stock images, asides from 'profilepicture.png' which was created by me. 
Asides from React, the 'styled-components' library was used, and the 'material-ui' framework for React. Dependencies are more explicity explained in the package.json file.
